The double is a lot more accurate than the float for example:
enter a float to calculate a sum: 100
sum: -6.55651e-07
enter a double to calculate a sum: 100
sum: 6.66134e-16

enter a float to calculate a sum: 10
sum: 1.19209e-07
enter a double to calculate a sum: 10
sum: -1.11022e-16

enter a float to calculate a sum: 9
sum: 0
enter a double to calculate a sum: 9
sum: 2.22045e-16

enter a float to calculate a sum: 8
sum: 0
enter a double to calculate a sum: 8
sum: 0

The floats stay 0 for longer, but since the double is more accurate, it doesn't answer zero as much, but is way more closer.
